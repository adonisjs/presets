# AdonisJS presets

These presets are a collection of functions you can execute to configure an AdonisJS package. This repo contains presets only for those packages that can be configured from multiple user interactions.

For example: When you create a new AdonisJS application, you can configure Lucid and also you can create a new app without Lucid and configure it later.

So, instead of duplicating the code in multiple places, we create re-usable presets and use them with individual packages and the [create-adonisjs](https://npm.im/create-adonisjs) initializer.
